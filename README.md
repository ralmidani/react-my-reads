## What This is

This was built as the final project for the React Fundamentals course, part of Udacity's React Nanodegree program. It is an app representing a personal library with three shelves. Books can be moved between shelves, and the user can also search for new books (take note of the search terms supported in SEARCH_TERMS.md) to add to a shelf.

This project demonstrates my knowledge of React (with ES6), including utilizing component lifecycle methods, loading data from a remote server, managing state, passing props to child components, rendering with JSX, and handling routing with React Router.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ralmidani/react-my-reads.git`
2. Change into the new directory: `cd react-my-reads`
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Run it: `yarn start` or `npm start`
